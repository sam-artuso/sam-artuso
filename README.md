Hello! 👋 I'm Sam and I love coding and all things geek 🤓.

I'm originally from Italy 🇮🇹🍝 but I've lived in London for a long time.

I have worked in the City as a consultant for the likes of Financial Times and Lloyds.

My interests include popular science 🧪, space 🚀, financial trading 📈, cryptocurrencies ₿ and artificial intelligence 🧠.
