# Hi! 👋

I'm Sam, I love coding and all things geek 🤓.

I'm originally from Italy 🇮🇹🍝 but I've lived in London for a long time.

I have worked for years in the City of London as a consultant, for the likes of Financial Times and Lloyds Banking Group.

My interests include functional programming, popular science 🧪, space 🚀, finance 📈, cryptocurrencies ₿ and artificial intelligence 🧠.
